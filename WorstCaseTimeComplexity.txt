Worst-case running time of methods:

1. Direct Addressing
 ADD(voterid , candidateid) -> O(1) for each record . The loop will have n interations at most to add 'n' elements.Hence, O(n) complexity for adding all records from file into array.

 FIND(voterid) -> O(1) . Find operation in a sorted array always has O(1) time complexity as the index is directly accessed without any comparisons.

 COUNT(candidateid) -> O(n). The loop will have n interations at most to compare the value of candidate ID with 'n' elements in order to determine count.Hence, O(n) complexity.

2. Hash Table
 ADD(voterid , candidateid) -> O(1) for each record. Running time for every record= constant time [getting hash and putting the record in hashed location]. hence, utmost n iterations and hence O(n) complexity for adding all records from file into hash map.

 FIND(voterid) -> O(1). Running time = constant time[getting hash and returning record from hashed location]. For any find operation, hash map will have constant running time which is O(1).

 COUNT(candidateid) -> O(n). The loop will have n interations at most to compare the value of candidate ID with 'n' elements in order to determine count.Hence, O(n) complexity.
